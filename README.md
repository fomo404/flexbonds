## How It Works

### Bonding Assets

1. **Select an NFT**: Choose any NFT‚Äîyours or someone else's.
2. **Set a Passkey**: Create a secure passkey. This passkey is never stored on-chain or off-chain.
3. **Bond Assets**: Bond SOL or tokens to the NFT. The assets are stored securely in a vault associated with the NFT.

### Passkey Mechanism

- **Off-Chain Key Generation**: Generate a passkey public/private key pair locally.
- **Secure Signing**: Sign a challenge nonce from the vault to prove knowledge of the passkey without exposing it.
- **Prevent Replay Attacks**: The use of a nonce ensures each transaction is unique and secure.

### Unbonding Assets

1. **Ownership Verification**: Only the NFT owner can initiate unbonding.
2. **Passkey Requirement**: Provide the passkey to unlock the assets.
3. **Secure Retrieval**: Assets are transferred back to your wallet securely.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Security**: Protect your assets from hackers and drainers by making them invisible in wallet balances.
- **Privacy**: Keep your holdings confidential and unknown to potential bad actors.
- **Value Addition**: Increase the intrinsic value of NFTs by bonding assets.
- **Flexibility**: Ideal for gamification, rewards, secure transfers, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Solana Wallet**: Ensure you have a Solana-compatible wallet (e.g., Phantom, Solflare).

```typescript
Generating passkey function 

```


```typescript
import { PublicKey } from '@solana/web3.js';
import { deriveChallengeKeypair } from 'flex-bonds-sdk';

// Your passkey and NFT mint address
const passKey = 'your-secure-passkey';
const nftMintAddress = new PublicKey('Your NFT Mint Address');

// Generate the challenge Keypair
const challengeKeypair = deriveChallengeKeypair(passKey, nftMintAddress);

// Now you can use `challengeKeypair` to sign the challenge nonce
```

**A:** Yes, Flex Bonds fully supports SPL Tokens & **Token2022** tokens.

### Q5: How is my passkey secured during transactions?
